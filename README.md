description:
We needed a sensor to locate dynamic obstacles on the form of adversary
robots. The straight solution was to buy LIDARS but they were so expensive and we couldnâ€™t
afford them.So, my colleague and I, we developed an equivalent sensor that approximates the
distance and the angle to a dynamic obstacle using encoded IR signals sent from a transmitter
based on the dynamic obstacle to a receiver on the robot.

Work accomplished:
-Prototyping multiple ideas.
-designing PCB of the sensor.
-Programming the firmware of the sensor.
